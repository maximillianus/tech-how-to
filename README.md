# tech-how-to
This repo contains my how to guide to install and initiate new technology. It is good as a starting point if we want to learn new tech. It is also a good way for me to validate how good I understand the context. I try to dumb this down as much as possible so **anybody** from any background will have as least difficulty as possible to understand this.
